# HW-3
# Mvc3ViewDemo
This program exercise was demonstrated to show the difference between dynamic and strongly typed view. When I ran the program i simply ran to HTTP Error 404. Page not found. I do not know for what reasons.

# Dynamic vs Strongly typed views:
Strongly typed views are very useful in MVC for rendering model data on page and binding the properties with the input fields. Moreover, strongly typed views give intellisense support, so that we can choose the right property name for the control.
Dynamic keyword are used for initializing variables whose types are late bounded. This is different from var keyword where we know the type at compile time.
